Bio: I'm a product manager at Recidiviz, where I'm creating the digital infrastructure to support open criminal justice data throughout the US. In general, I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to use technology to coordinate communities towards more desirable futures (via participatory design, digital civic infrastructure, etc).
