Bio: I am a DAO enthusiast, Ph.D in politics. I was involved with many DAOs: core contributor of the_OpenDAO; Delegate of DEFI protocol DAO--eulerfinance DAO; Member of FWB, MatrixDAO(a Chinese private venture DAO), and SeeDAO(in my opinion the best Chinese DAO). Was multi-sig candidate of Project Galaxy DAO.
