Bio: I am an assistant professor of organization science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My research has explored the relational and affective dynamics of self-organized work. Keen to start new projects around the organization of commoning, but also different forms of decision-making and voting. How to scale self-governance amidst the paradoxical logics of collaborative community and network.
