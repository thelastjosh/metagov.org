Bio:

I'm Ellie/Lee - I'm working across various open science organizations. I focus mainly on how we get the right people in the room to build research infrastructure.

I do a lot of formal events in Open Science. And am happy to connect researchers who are building tools or have aligned research into those events.

I also generally like communicating things. Social media not so much - but essays or short blogs are fun.

I want more people building infrastructure for a better scientific ecosystem. Generally - if people have tools they want to plug in, that is a win for me!
