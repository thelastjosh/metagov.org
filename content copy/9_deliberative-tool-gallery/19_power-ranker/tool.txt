Description: Participants are asked to choose which of two items they prefer. Their choices create a graph of relationships among the items, which is then used as the basis for a “centrality ranking” of the items, interpreted as a percentage allocation of a budget. 		Participants may specify many counter-pairs at once, as well as a measure of preference intensity.
