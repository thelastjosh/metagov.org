Description: Participants are prompted with a specific policy, and asked to provide situations, or “cases” that are in the realm of the policy. Two rounds of voting follow:  1) Is this case covered by the existing policy?  Y/N 2) Should this case be covered by this policy?  Y/N  Policies can be manually revised, then voting repeats as needed
