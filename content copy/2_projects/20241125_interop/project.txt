Description: Scope: Digital tools that go beyond basic voting and commenting, and provide new capabilities to the governance ecosystemâ€”which may only be one step of a larger deliberative governance process. The processes these tools enable may be used for online community governance, AI governance and alignment, cooperative governance, citizen town halls or assemblies, or other kinds of institutional policy-making or decision-making.
