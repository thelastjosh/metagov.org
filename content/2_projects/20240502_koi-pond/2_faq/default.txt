Changes to assertions are tracked in a transaction record, enabling version control and the ability to fork these objects.

While conceptually similar to URIs (Universal Resource Identifier)s (of which URLs are a subset), RIDs operate on a broader scope. Not only can RIDs be used to reference URIs, but they can also point to knowledge objects located on your local machine (such as PDFs) as well as objects that exist offline (such as a printed publication). Thus, RIDs do not replace other reference systems, but instead unify several different reference systems under the same schema. If URIs represent a type of reference system, the RID system is a type system for references.</p><p>The basic elements of the RID system are means of references (or simply \"means\"), references, and associated actions. Means define the type of object an RID is pointing to, while the reference assigns a unique identifier to the knowledge object under the specified means. Together, the means and the reference form an RID for a given knowledge object, represented as means:reference.</p><p>For example, an RID referring to a Slack message could take the following form:</p><p><code>URL:https://metagov.slack.com/archives/C034GUA938W/p1645798649785169</code></p><p>In this example, <code>URL</code> is the means that describes the type of knowledge object that the reference (<u><a href=\"https://metagov.slack.com/archives/C034GUA938W/p1645798649785169\">https://metagov.slack.com/archives/C034GUA938W/p1645798649785169</a></u>) is pointing to. </p><p>Associated actions are functions that interact with, on, or through an RID in some capacity. For instance, a <code>transform</code> function can be called upon the RID listed above to define the same knowledge object with an alternative means. For instance, we could also represent the knowledge object above using a <code>slack_message</code> means, which would look like the following:</p><p><code>slack_message:metagov/C034GUA938W/p1645798649785169</code></p><p><code>slack_message(\"metagov/C034GUA938W/p1645798649785169\")</code></p><p><strong>For more information about RIDs, refer to the following resources:</strong></p>"},"id":"3c9cf666-c9e7-4349-a837-ea8231543153","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"- <a href=\"https://github.com/BlockScience/kms-identity\">https://github.com/BlockScience/kms-identity</a>\n- <a href=\"https://blog.block.science/objects-as-reference-toward-robust-first-principles-of-digital-organization/\">https://blog.block.science/objects-as-reference-toward-robust-first-principles-of-digital-organization/</a>\n- <a href=\"https://blog.block.science/a-language-for-knowledge-networks/\">https://blog.block.science/a-language-for-knowledge-networks/</a>\n<br>"},"id":"54104b74-d6e7-4830-b25d-d2c9322e685f","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"},{"content":{"text":"<p>“RIDs define digital objects as <em>references</em> which point to <em>referents. </em>References also have a <em>method</em>, or <em>way of referencing</em>, their referent(s).<em> </em>A single referent may be referenced by any number of digital objects, in a wide variety of ways.

Flexibility</em></strong></p><p>One of the main affordances of the RID system provides Metagov's KOI is the flexibility to structure and manipulate knowledge objects, depending on the use case.</p><p>For example, the RID system enables knowledge objects of vastly different scales to be represented within the KOI's Knowledge Management System. Consider a Govbase Airtable. Not only can the different rows, columns, and cells that comprise the table each be represented as their own distinct objects, but the table can also stand alone as a knowledge object in and of itself. Furthermore, the relationships between these different knowledge objects can be captured by their connections in the underlying graph database in which the KOI's knowledge objects are stored.</p><p>The RID system also embeds flexibility into Metagov's KOI by enabling the same knowledge object to simultaneously be assigned different RIDs (see <strong>What are RIDs?</strong> above for an example). As a result, a knowledge object can be equipped with distinct sets of tools, each of which can be indexed through its unique reference.</p><p>Overall, the RID system, integrated with a graph database, allows communities to organize knowledge objects in a way that doesn't conform to a fixed data structure. Thus, the KOI architecture is not a single-purpose tool, but rather a versatile infrastructure can be tailored to specific operational contexts. In order to optimize the functionality of its KOI, Metagov must collectively determine the types of knowledge that will inhabit its KOI, establish norms for defining and interpreting these knowledge object (and the relationships between them), and outline the intended uses of the KOI both within the community and by external entities.</p><p><strong><em>2. Ability to Reference Knowledge Objects without Accessing Them</em></strong></p><p>Another key affordance that the RID system offers Metagov's KOI is the ability to reference a knowledge object, regardless of whether the knowledge it contains is accessible. This capability allows the underlying graph database to function like a library's card catalogue, where each card points to a specific book. Like a catalogue card that remains in the library even if the book has been checked out, an RID continues to reference a knowledge object, such as a Slack post, even if the KOI cannot access its contents, either due to permission restrictions or deletion. the knowledge it contains, either because it does not have the restricted permissions or deletion.</p><p>This distinction between the reference and the referent affords better permissioning and  privacy. <u><a href=\"https://blog.block.science/a-language-for-knowledge-networks/\">According to Michael Zargham &amp; Ilan Ben-Meir at BlockScience</a></u>, \"[D]ifferentiating reference from referent makes it possible for organizations to have <em>internality on the technical level —</em> which, in turn, makes it possible for organizations to communicate with other organizations <em>about</em> their internalities (that is, their organization’s knowledge), without having to also grant outsiders access to its inner workings.\" </p><p>Another benefit of distinguishing the reference from the referent is that knowledge objects do not need to be duplicated across platforms in order to make use of their contents. Instead, the system it observes and points to data where it already exists in the world.</p><p><strong><em>3. Voice Plurality</em></strong></p><p>Unlike most technical systems which operate on the basis of a \"ground truth\", Metagov's KOI embraces subjectivity and supports plurality. Because the RID system and graph database offer the freedom to skirt the confines of fixed data structures, Metagov's KOI does not need a unified representation of a knowledge object or their relationships. Instead, it allows for the organization of knowledge into various sets that reflect different perspectives throughout the community. For instance, the community could decide to construct a 'core' Metagov identity within the KOI, which could include Metagov's code of conduct, by-laws, governance policies, and other official Metagov documentation. Similarly, sub-communities, such as those subscribed to #ostromnauts could create a knowledge set with knowledge objects that relate to polycentricity, commons theory, neo-institutional economics, etc. In this way, Metagov's KOI should be (this one of our hypotheses) able to capture the plurality of perspectives within the community, while also projecting a unified organizational voice.</p>"},"id":"c6508290-5a46-40f6-85bb-aadb81233fe2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<h2 id=\"uses\">What will KOI be used for? <a href=\"#content\">↵</a></h2>"},"id":"d68fb692-f642-4dbe-b3ac-c9ba95edc48f","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The KOI is designed to be a flexible tool that can be used towards a variety of different use cases.

We also envision KOI as a reflexivity tool through which Metagov can better understand its identity, its functions, and its processes as an organization.
