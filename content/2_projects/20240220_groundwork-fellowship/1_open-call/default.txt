In other words, internet infrastructure structures how communities make decisions and self-govern. But who is part of the process in designing this infrastructure, and who is left out? How could online governance be different with more inclusive design processes?</p><p>The Groundwork Fellowship is a three month online fellowship hosted by Metagov meant to bring community-based researchers into this design process. We are aiming to convene a cohort or 4-6 fellows actively working and experimenting within communities currently under-represented in these technical conversations. In particular, we are interested in working with fellows who can give voice to communities experiencing either online or offline marginalization due to internet infrastructure injustices or inequalities.
