Originally intended as a collaboration between Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center and the MIT Media Lab, we officially incorporated as an independent nonprofit in January 2020, with Josh, Louis, Prima, and Larry serving as the initial board and Josh as the founding executive director. </p><p>Almost immediately upon starting, we brought Nathan Schneider, Amy Zhang, and Seth Frey into a “core group” of co-authors working on what eventually became <u><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449090\">modular politics, the paper</a></u>. Later in the year, this core group—the precursor to Metagov’s research directors—expanded to include Divya Siddarth, Michael Zargham (who also joined our board as treasurer), Shauna Gordon-McKeon, and Federica Carugati.</p><p>We received our first grant near the end of 2020, from the Grant for the Web, to implement the <u><a href=\"http://gateway.metagov.org\">Metagov Gateway</a></u>. Since then, Metagov has grown to receive over $1 million in grants and over $1 million in grants for our fiscally sponsored projects, recruited 14 Research Directors, amassed a community of over 1,000 people in our Slack, and transitioned ED’s from Joshua Tan to Eugene Leventhal.

In her role of Research Director at Metagov, she is involved in a variety of projects related to the analysis and design of new governance models leveraging blockchain and AI.

His work explores the intersection between artificial and collective intelligence. He has previously held fellowships at Stanford (at the Digital Civil Society Lab), Princeton (in the CS department), and MIT (in the math department) and taught at Harvard (in the law school) and Carnegie Mellon (in the policy school). His work has been funded by the NSF, Ford Foundation, EPSRC, EU Next Generation Internet, Henry Luce Foundation, One Project, NIST, Ethereum Foundation, Optimism Foundation, and others.

In the role of Research Director, his focus is on how data is captured, organized, and put to use -- with emphasis on the interplay between human and machine decision making. This work has included work on Govbase, Telescope bot and Attention Economies. Currently, he serves as the Co-PI on the KOI-Pond Project with Ellie Rennie.
