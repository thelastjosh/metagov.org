Contributing: I like to participate in discussions on the latest in the regulatory and legal situation. In-person events provide the greatest value and connection, so I am always interested in helping to facilitate them. I am effectively working two jobs right now, so I can not commit to contributing more this right now. When I have more spare time, I will be able to find more ways to participate.
