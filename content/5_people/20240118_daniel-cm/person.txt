Contributing: I've never been involved in long-term research collectives beyond established institutions; all had finite goals. I really enjoyed helping out in them. I'm a good listener, so I'm at home in environments where there is a shared strategic goal and inductive, explorative processes. I'm looking for ways/processes to make research matter beyond knowledge production, to have reach and a voice. I would be hoping launch a project.
