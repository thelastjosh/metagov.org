Contributing: I like to design multidisciplinary spaces for experimentation between art, science and design and build tools for decision making. I ask media philosophical questions and love to use art as inspiration for concept development. I am particularly excited by art and archival practices that combine the archaeological and historical with the speculative and future-oriented.
