Contributing: In undergrad at W&M, I was a member or founder of several research orgs, collabs, and community-based projects for international relations, global development, and spatial data. I enjoy co-creating spaces where people and ideas thrive. These days, I am increasingly qualitative, and enjoy parsing through archives and exploring new urban spaces in the greater Tokyo area. With Spectra Cities, I’m working to grow a decentralized community of interdisciplinary thinkers, multimedia creators, and optimistic urbanists.
