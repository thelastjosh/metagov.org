Value over hype! That comes first. I've been doing research in the DAO space on leadership, DEI and onboarding practices. For me, the important question that we always have to ask is "What is this going to be used for?"
I would like to contribute with rigurous research and stablish partnerships with institutions or groups that may benefit from our studies.
