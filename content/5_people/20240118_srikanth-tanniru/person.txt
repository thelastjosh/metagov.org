Contributing: I am here to learn to understand the multi disciplinary skills that are required to build a DAO. I'm interested in many aspects in life that includes education, spirituality, entertainment, enterpreneurship, business, technology, physiology, psychology, politics, law, economics and the list goes on. I want to work for evolution but not revolution and thereby drive the change that is necessary for upcoming generations of the mankind. I'm more of critical thinking and less of computation thinking. I'm curious about everything all the time and dispassionate towards myself at times. I can learn things fast and my thirst for quest is never ending. In short, I'm a life long learner and deeming to build a DAO for Open Source Gamified Education in Metaverse.
