Activist governance nerd career path - I want to find my place in the community as one who innovates and builds novel social organization for the disenfranchised, but I need someone to show me how to get there.
Questions I would have include:
- What does it mean to ‘find community’? What roles does community play/not play in my journey?
- What sort of jobs should I take at each stage?
