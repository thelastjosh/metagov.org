Bio: I'm Shawn, co-founder & CEO @ Matterverse, a cloud-rendered metaverse editor backed by YCombinator China & LD Capital. I'm also an active contributor to a few DAOs and very interested in learning/contributing to DAO governance standards. I would love get involved and help you with research and hope to translate the DAO constitution template into Chinese to help make this more accessible.
