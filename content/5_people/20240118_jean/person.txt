Contributing: DAO is an open and innovative space, I join with the hope to help builders shipping their viable products as soon as possible and spread the words for feedback. I can foster the growth by: 1. Test product demo/Pitch Deck and write review 2. Narrow down the niche with product team to help with Market Fit. 3. Explore and connect with thought leaders in the field to involve them in developing the projects.
