Bio:

I'm Nitin—I currently work at Metagov as a Project Manager and also as a Research Analyst at a non-profit consulting firm. I'm interested in improving internal processes within organizations and helping to fund initiatives grounded in social impact, climate action, and collaborations with governments.

I enjoy cooking and hosting, and I'm in the process of creating a mini cookbook featuring recipes I've made for friends and ones they've shared with me during my year in New York. Additionally, I plan to work with my mother to document our family recipes so they don't get lost over time.

I'm always excited to chat about anything people are passionate about working on, even if I don't fully understand it at first glance. If you have something you're excited about working on, feel free to hit me up—I'd love to hear about it!
